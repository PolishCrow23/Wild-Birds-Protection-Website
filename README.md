A website I made for a campain "Ban Spikes" which aims to spread awarness about dangers of metal spikes for different species of wild birds.
The website is created in Astro. I am planning to implement Decap CMS in it, so the client does not have to reply on me publishing the blog posts.
The website was designed by an UX designer Aneta Sobaniec.
